          - In the first decade of this newly built Spanish city. Intramuros buildings were made up of flammable materials, making it vulnerable to earthquakes, typhoons, and fires. The officials were so tired rebuilding destroyed structures again and again. And they've come with an idea of making Intramuros a Stone Fortified City.<br><br>
          A priest named Antonio Sedeno was appointed by Governor General Santiago de Vera to design the fortification of Intramuros' southern and vulnerable areas.

The structure of these walls were made up of Volcanic Tuff and Stone making it impenetrable and protected from foreign and local invaders, This materials came up from Guadalupe, San Pedro de Makati(now known as Makati).<br><br> Intramuros was not constructed by these Colonizers, instead it was constructed by the Indios or "The Indigenous people of the Philippines"

        <li>
          <strong>1645</strong>
          - An earthquake damaged and toppled the portions of the wall and most of the buildings inside the city. Mortar and Stone were now used as a construction material but there was no guarantee with strength on structures.<br><br>This marked the beginning of Arquitectura Mestiza, the fusion of European and local building techniques. Plus, the considerations of living in the Ring of Fire. Manila was patterned after Spanish and Mexican cities. Structures consisted of two-storey stone and mortar buildings that were vaulted in stone. <br><br>This proved to be dangerous when there's an earthquake. A mixed style appeared consisting of a lower storey of mortar and stone, and an upper story of wood. Stone vaults were avoided. All buildings followed this new method  in construction. The only vaulted building that survived was the San Agustin Church built in 1604.

The Spanish government was neutral at first but because of France's string of major losses at the hands of the British, it posed a great threat to Spain's own personal interests. For two years, the British had full control of the city.

          - There were a lot of drastic changes in Intramuros during the American period. The Ayuntamiento became the home of the Philippine Commission. The Philippine Commission preceded the Philippine Senate that was established in 1916 in accordance to the Jones Act. Fort Santiago also became the headquarters of the Philippine Division of the Unites States Army. Portions of the walls especially near the Pasig were demolished to improve and widen the wharves by the river.

          <strong>1905</strong>
          - Architect Daniel Burnham went to Manila to plan the city. He stated that "The old walled city of Intramuros at the mouth of the Pasig River is one of the best preserved medieval cities anywhere in the world." Part of his plan was to fill the moats with earth and convert it to a green space. It was then converted to a municipal golf course (Intramuros Gold Course) that is still being used today. It is one of the oldest golf courses in the Philippines. The Americans also reclaimed land in Manila Bay obstructing Intramuros' close view of the bay.

Intramuros originally had 8 great churches. Yes, it had that many.

          <strong>Sep 1, 1939 - Sep 2, 1945</strong>
          - All was well until one tragic event occurred that changed the course of history and the fate of the walled city. World War II happened and Intramuros' old glory was shattered. Three centuries worth of history and heritage was eradicated. 90% of Manila including Intramuros was razed to the ground by bombs of both the Japanese and the Americans. Sad to say, Manila's pearl lost it's shine. Rubble is all that remains of this once rich and thriving city of the Far East

        <li>
          <strong>Post War - Present</strong>
          - Intramuros' former grandeur remains a thing of the past. A memory that haunts me completely. Feelings of sadness, pride and grief come rushing to mind whenever I see old photographs of our once famed city. Unfortunately, Intramuros wasn't rebuilt completely after the war. It was not restored to its pre-war glory which I find really saddening. <br><br>The government did not give much attention to the rehabilitation of the old city. Modern, box buildings replaced the medieval Hispanic churches and schools that gave Intramuros that undeniable charm. It makes me really upset and quite mad that a treasure was taken away from us. The least we can do right now, as Filipinos, is to acknowledge what we once had and to appreciate what we presently have. Intramuros still has hope and if we work together, slowly but surely, we can restore Intramuros to its former glory.
